		<h2>Key Partners</h2>
		<p>When you run a business you won't be doung everything yourself, you can try but there are other companies that can do some of the tasks better than you, these are all key partners. Explore each activity and decide whether we can best serve our customer segments by undertaking the activity ourselves or whether it makes more sense to work with a partner.For example it makes sense to pay Amazon to manage servers rather than buy racks of machines. Key partners can help you deliver activities and resources at a much lower cost than doing it yourself but also introduce risk and factors outside your control.  </p>
	</div>

	<div id="keyactivities" class="plan-desc">
		<h2>Key Activities</h2>
		<p>If Key resources are the assets we need for our business. Key activities are all the important activities we should undertake to ensure success. Key activities can be grouped under the following
	<ul>
		<li>Production</li>
		<li>Problem Solving</li>
		<li>Platform Activities</li>
	</ul>	
	Companies that manufacture and produce physical products usually have Production as their key activity. Consultants, Hospitals and some service organisations undertake problem solving activites, whilst Network brands and software are the kinds of products that fall under a platform category. Key activites should be linked back to key resources by determining what resources are requried to make the key activites a reality 
</p>
	</div>

	<div id="valuepropsitions" class="plan-desc">
		<h2>Value Propsitions</h2>
		<p>"Propsition" is a fancy term for the product or service that you are proposing. To define or communicate the proposition to others we should be able to answer the following questions
<ul>
<li>What value do we deliver to our customer segments</li>
<li>What problems are we helping to solve</li>
<li>What cusotmer needs or wants are we satisfying</li>
</ul>
Once you have the answers to these questions it becomes easier to associate the specific features with the customer needs needs and wants.
</p>
	</div>

	<div id="customerrelations" class="plan-desc">
		<h2>Customer Relations</h2>
		<p>This defines any interactions with our customers. You should think about 3 primary activites:
			<ul>
			<li>Customer Acquisition - How will you aquire new customers</li>
			<li>Customer Retention - How will you keep existing customers engaged and happy</li>
			<li>Upselling - How you upsell products to exisiting customers to maximise revenue from them </li>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="channels" class="plan-desc">
		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Channels is the term applied to the methods by which you interface with your customers. When exploring channels think about the following:
		<ul>
		<li>[Awareness] - Using this channel how can you raise awareness?</li>
		<li>[Evaluation] - What kinds of methods of evaluation are you offering your customers?</li>
		<li>[Purchase] - How can a customer purchase your product? </li>
		<li>[Delivery] - How will you deliver your product once the customer has purchased it?</li>
		<li>[Post Purchase] - How do we offer post purchase support to our customers</li>
		</ul>
</p>
	</div>

	<div id="customersegments" class="plan-desc">
		<h2>Customer Segments</h2>
		<p>Customer segments are the different groups of people or organistations that you are going to reach out to and do business with. We call this section customer segments because we can usually idetify customers in seperate and distinct groups that necessitate different strategies in terms of customer relationships, channels and revenue. </p>
		<p>
		Grouping customers into segments involves looking at their relationships with other parts of our business model for example. If you modify your proposition for some cusomters they are a different segment, if you reach these customers through a different channel than your usual customers they are a different segment and if the revenue stream is different ... different segment. You could have one mass market segment e.g. Playstation or Xbox. You could have a niche market were you focus on a very specific customer segment for example Consultants. When defining your customer segments start from a high level. e.g. Apple have a customer segment for people who want to listen to music on the go, this segment is then broken down into small form factor, large storage base or touch screen capable of running apps.

Key resource can be physical, intellectual, human or financial. Complining your list of key resources will help you understand your strengths and weaknesses.
